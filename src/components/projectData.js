        question: 'How can we support activists in dismantling the deepfake sexual crime cartel?',
        motivation: "From the 2020 Nth Room case to the 2024 Telegram deepfake sexual crimes, women in South Korea have been increasingly targeted by anonymous perpetrators who use their personal information to generate and share deepfake pornography in Telegram chat rooms. This issue extends beyond digital harassment, forming a broader criminal cartel that commodifies women to facilitate further illegal activities, including real-world exploitation, drug trafficking, and illegal gambling. Existing efforts to combat these crimes have focused on tracking deepfake models or analyzing sexually exploitative messages, which are often ineffective due to Telegram's security features.",
        approach: "This project explores how automated tools that incorporate activists undercover tracking strategies can support activists and police investigators in long-term undercover operations targeting Telegram's digital sexual crime cartels, while also mitigating PTSD. The 'Fake the Deepfake Bot', a Telegram persona bot designed to automatically engage in conversations with perpetrators, gather evidence of crimes shared within chat rooms, and collect profile information of chat room participants. The system was designed based on interviews with three expert groups: activists engaged in tracking and supporting victims, police investigators with experience in digital sexual crimes and international Telegram investigations, and legal professionals assisting victims and providing insights into the evidence required for prosecuting offenders.",
